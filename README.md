ASIMO ([*Developed from HRP*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_Robotics_Project)) is my attempt at rewriting the [hrp](https://github.com/HusqvarnaResearch/hrp) software in rust. I [previously wrote](https://github.com/Lexate/hrp_py) a similar library in python which worked but required working around the language to handle strict typing in the protocol. I want this library to be more robust and serve as a base for testing robotics software like the original project.
