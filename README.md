ASIMO ([*Developed from HRP*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_Robotics_Project))
is my attempt at rewriting the [hrp](https://github.com/HusqvarnaResearch/hrp) software in rust.
I previously wrote a similar library in python which worked
but required working around the language to handle strict typing in the protocol.
I want this library to be more robust and serve as a base for testing robotics software
like the original project.
